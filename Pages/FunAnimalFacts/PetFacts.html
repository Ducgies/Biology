            <h2>Dogs and Cats are Colorblind</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    This isn’t to say that dogs and cats only see in black in white. They can still see in color.
                    However,
                    they don’t see as many colors as we humans do. Humans have three cone photoreceptors, which allow us
                    to
                    see red, blue, and green. Dogs and cats, however, only have two cones for blue and green<sup><a
                            id="1">1</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dogs tend to see color in the yellow part of the spectrum, so red, yellow, green, and orange are
                    harder
                    for dogs to distinguish between. It is said that cats tend to see blues and grays, but some
                    researchers
                    believe that they also only see the yellow part of the spectrum, just like dogs<sup><a
                            id="2">2</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s a reason why cats and dogs don’t have as many cones as humans. According to Dr. Patty Khuly
                    on
                    the Embrace Pet Insurance website,
                </p>
                <blockquote class="text-end my-4">
                    “Pets don’t need to see as many colors. After all, they’re hunters who are primarily carnivorous.
                    They
                    don’t need to worry so much about mistaking one kind of edible plant for another, for example. As
                    predators, they’re much more concerned about being able to see their prey move on a landscape or in
                    a
                    forest. Contrast is everything”

            <h2>Dogs Have an Incredible Sense of Smell</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    A dog’s nose has around 300 million olfactory receptors, while humans only have six million. In
                    fact, if
                    you were to put one teaspoon of sugar in two Olympic-sized pools, a dog would be able to sniff it
                    out<sup><a id="3">3</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of their incredible sense of smell, they are often used to smell for drugs, bombs, and dead
                    bodies. Dogs are also used experimentally to sniff out diseases in humans, such as cancer<sup><a

            <h2>Cats Spend 70% of Their Lives Sleeping</h2>
            <p>
                Cats are known to be big nappers, but did you know that the average cat spends around 70% of their life
                sleeping<sup><a id="5">5</a></sup>? On average, cats sleep for 15 hours a day. Kittens and older cats
                can
                even sleep for 20
                hours a day<sup><a id="6">6</a></sup>!
            </p>
            <p>
                However, unlike how humans sleep only once during the nighttime, cats sleep multiple times throughout
                the
                day, but usually very lightly. In fact, their deep sleep is only around five minutes, as their naps can
                take
                about 15-20 minutes<sup><a id="5">5</a></sup>.

            <h2>Goldfish Actually Have Good Memories</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    There’s a common myth that goldfish only have three-second memories, but that isn’t true! In fact,
                    goldfish can have memories that can last for weeks, months, or years. They can also remember the
                    faces
                    of their owners<sup><a id="7">7</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are actually multiple studies that showed how good goldfish memories are. According to Adam
                    Jones<sup><a id="8">8</a></sup>
                    from The Goldfish Tank website:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="text-end my-4">
                    “At least two separate studies into goldfish memory have proven that they remember things for more
                    than
                    just three seconds. In the first study, scientists added a lever to a goldfish tank, which dispensed
                    food when pressed. Once goldfish learned to press the lever, they would regularly return to it to
                    get
                    more food. Even more amazingly, the goldfish actually learned to press the lever at the right time
                    of
                    day! Researchers adjusted the lever so that it would only dispense food within a one-hour window…
                    and
                    the fish learned to come back each day around that time!”

            <h2>Hamsters are Nocturnal</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Unlike humans, which are diurnal (awake during the day), and cats/dogs, which are crepuscular (awake
                    during dawn)<sup><a id="9">9</a></sup> hamsters are nocturnal, which means they are awake at night.
                    41%
                    of their time
                    is also spent on sleeping. Some hamsters can be diurnal, but it is rare. Furthermore, wild hamsters
                    tend
                    to be crepuscular, just like cats<sup><a id="10">10</a></sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason why hamsters are nocturnal is to prevent themselves from being seen during the night by
                    predators. This also allows them to look for food as there are fewer dangers (Hamsteropedia). The
                    nose-whiskers of hamsters allow them to maneuver during the night, as well as their sense of
